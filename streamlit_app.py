    1.  **Upload Screenshots:** Use the file uploader below to select one or more screenshots of your trading charts (PNG or JPG format).
    2.  **Assign Timeframes:** For each uploaded screenshot, select the corresponding timeframe (e.g., 1H, 15M, D) from the dropdown menu below the image.
    3.  **Analyze:** Once all timeframes are set, click the "Analyze Uploaded Screenshots" button.
    4.  **Review Feedback:** The AI will analyze the charts based on ICT principles and the pre-defined Continuation/Reversal checklists. The analysis will appear in the section below the button.

    **Tips:**
    *   Provide clear screenshots from different key timeframes (e.g., Daily, 4H, 1H, 15M) for a comprehensive analysis.
    *   Ensure price action, relevant highs/lows, and potential areas of interest (FVGs, OBs) are visible.
